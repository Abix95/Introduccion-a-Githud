        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t <em>talk</em>, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, <em>reading</em>,<strong> writing</strong>, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his<strong> ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are<em> born</em> to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong <em>answer</em> making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most <strong>beautiful</strong>, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic <em>ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
